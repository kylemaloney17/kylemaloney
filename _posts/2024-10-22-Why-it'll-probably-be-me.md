Before I started building ImagineAI I was wondering why I was the only one working on this. It turns out it's fucking hard. These stories sometimes dont story. Even if I get it to make great stories I gotta get people to want to use the product. The idea is kinda crazy to begin with. It's also kinda strange cause im not exactly solving a problem, it's more so creating something that people didn't know that they wanted. My goal is making the stories good enough that people love them so that they tell other people that they are good. I'll worry about getting it to the point of automation later. No point in automating things cause I dont even know if this is the process I want. I know the product is pretty good but I dont know if the process is there so no point in automation. Anyway to get this thing off the ground it's gonna take some brute force. I think it's like a rocket. You gotta propel it up then it'll start to orbit. So it'll probably be me to do this cause I dont wanna stop.
